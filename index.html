        <h4>I am Learing to Code Because...</h4>
        <p>I have a longstanding passion for all things 'tech,' so to be able to join the Code Fellows family has been a bucket list item for a number years. </p>
        <p>Professionally I am taking this opportunity the DoD has offered me to absorb as much as I can in hopes of using that knowledge to protect our nation from those who would do us harm.</p>
        <p>Personally, I am so excited to make use of these web development skills to build in customized functionality to my own website project below...</p>
